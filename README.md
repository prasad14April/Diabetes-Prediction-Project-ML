Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning using Pima Dataset
# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a patient has diabetes based on medical diagnostic features.

This project demonstrates my understanding of:
- Data Cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Scaling
- Model Building
- Model Evaluation
- Performance Comparison

## 📊 Dataset Information

The dataset used is the **Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset**.

Features included:

- Pregnancies
- Glucose
- BloodPressure
- SkinThickness
- Insulin
- BMI
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction
- Age
- Outcome (Target Variable)

The target variable:
- 0 → Non-Diabetic
- 1 → Diabetic

## 🔍 Project Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values
- Handled zero values in medical features
- Verified data types

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distribution plots
- Correlation heatmap
- Feature relationship analysis
- Identified important predictors

### 3️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Train-test split
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler

### 4️⃣ Model Building
